Problem: Largest Item in a Stack

Problem Definition:
Given a stack class with push(item), pop(), and peek() implemented with O(1) time. Implement a new stack class with a method getMax() that returns the largest item in the stack.

Solution:
MaxStack.py implements MaxStack class based on Stack class in StackModule.py with getMax() method which takes O(1) time and O(m) space where m is the number of operations called on the stack.
